# nap

NAP is a hobby project that I have long wanted to do. Rather than spend an inordinate amount of time figuring out what to name the project I went with Not Another Program (NAP), but if you prefer you can think of it as Next-generation Accounting Platform.

NAP is a horizontal, project-native, multi-entity ERP. The base ERP core — multi-tenant infrastructure, RBAC, master data (vendors, clients, employees, contacts, companies), projects, activities, AP/AR, double-entry accounting, cashflow, and profitability — is designed to be industry-agnostic. However, the initial release of the project will focus on the construction industry and the services necessary to meet those needs

## Stack

PERN — Postgres 18, Express 5, React 19, Node 24. Schema-per-tenant isolation via the owned pg-schemata library. JWT (httpOnly cookies) for auth; Redis for permission caching; MUI 9 + MUI X Data Grid v9 on the client.

If you run a modified version of NAP over a network, you must make the modified source available to your users. This is intentional: NAP is open infrastructure.
