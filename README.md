# nap

NAP is a hobby project that I have long wanted to do. Rather than spend an inordinate amount of time figuring out what to name the project I went with Not Another Program (NAP), but if you prefer you can think of it as Next-generation Accounting Platform.

NAP is a horizontal, project-native, multi-company ERP. The base ERP core — multi-tenant infrastructure, RBAC, master data (vendors, clients, employees, contacts, companies), projects, activities, AP/AR, double-entry accounting, cashflow, and profitability — is designed to be industry-agnostic. However, the initial release of the project will focus on the construction industry and the services necessary to meet those needs

## Stack

NAP uses PostgreSQL, Express, React, and Node. The API is a modular monolith
with a separate central administration database and one or more tenant-cell
databases. Cell databases use shared tenant tables protected by PostgreSQL
row-level security, enforced through a non-owning runtime role rather than
forced on the table owner. Redis caches derived session, routing, and
authorization state so those lookups stay off the database path, but
PostgreSQL always decides: no authorization outcome depends on the cache.

The [platform specification](docs/specs/nap-platform-specification.md) owns
these choices. Its
[technology stack](docs/specs/nap-platform-specification.md#technology-stack)
section names one dependency per role and the boundary each one sits behind;
[deployment topology](docs/specs/nap-platform-specification.md#deployment-topology)
and
[database composition roots](docs/specs/nap-platform-specification.md#database-composition-roots)
own the admin-and-cell split; requirements `ARCH-013`-`ARCH-021` own tenant
isolation and `ARCH-029` owns the Redis boundary. Package manifests, the
lockfile, `.nvmrc`, and `tsconfig.base.json` own the exact installed versions
and compiler settings.

## Documentation

Start with the [documentation index](docs/README.md). It defines the authority,
purpose, reading order, and update relationship of PRDs, ADRs, RULES, project
structure, the development roadmap, and reference material.
